## 📌 Example Summary Format

````markdown
# Scapy  

**Category:** Networking / Packet Analysis  

**What it is:**  
A powerful Python library for crafting, sending, sniffing, and dissecting network packets.  

**Use cases:**  
- Writing custom packet sniffers  
- Building or testing protocols  
- Security research & penetration testing  

**Example:**  
```python
from scapy.all import IP, ICMP, sr1

pkt = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
resp = sr1(pkt, timeout=1)
if resp:
    print("Reply received from", resp.src)
````

```
